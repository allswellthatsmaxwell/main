# main
An all-in-one repository for a lot of my work.

## Separate projects in this repository:

### WindyGridWorld
Teaching an agent to navigate a grid world under different conditions.

#### Status 
I have the thing successfully navigating a static world with holes in it. The holes send it back to the start, so it has to avoid them to do well.

### Songs
Trying to learn good representations for words in songs, to see if I can find things out about... song-language, or something.

#### Status
Just read in data and processed it a little bit.
