# main
An all-in-one repository for Julia work, including a reinforcement learning agent and a lyrics model.

## Separate projects in this repository:

### WindyGridWorld
Teaching an agent to navigate a grid world under different conditions.

#### Status 
I have the thing successfully navigating a static world with holes in it. The holes send it back to the start, so it has to avoid them to do well.

### Songs
Trying to learn good representations for words in songs, to see if I can find things out about... song-language, or something. Using a neural network with character-level input.

#### Status
Got a decent data pre-processing pipe, and a basic network running.
